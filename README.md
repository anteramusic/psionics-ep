## 🌌 About

**PSIONICS** is a cerebral dive into synthetic energy and digital mysticism.  
Blending heavy electro house rhythms with dark, classical influence, this EP evokes a moody, cinematic experience tailored for introspection, deep focus, or dystopian dancefloors.

This release is inspired by the *do-it-ourselves* philosophy seen in artists like Bankai, who embrace openness and community-driven creativity. While this EP doesn't include stems, it carries the same spirit—collaborative, remixable, and anti-gatekeep.
