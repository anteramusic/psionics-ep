## 🌌 About

**PSIONICS** is a cerebral dive into synthetic energy and digital mysticism.  
Blending heavy electro house rhythms with dark, classical influence, this EP evokes a moody, cinematic experience tailored for introspection, deep focus, or dystopian dancefloors.

## 🎧 Tracklist

1. **psionics**  
   I made this originally during covid on my couch in 3 or so days then spent the rest of my days worrying about if it's ok or not and if I need to change the bridge, but now I love the bridge and it's distorted wormmy bass

2. **Scintillating Stomata**  
   this track is about my migraines and the things I see before I get them. Go ahead, image search the title of this track. I get this visual rainbow zigzag in my vision before a horrible headache but honestly it's quite beautiful in a way.  
   The track tries to capture the progression of feeling when it comes on.

3. **Heist**  
   a follow up in title and spirit to my previous release when I was in College. "Taylor Thomas - Getaway Van" where I sampled the engine start of a friends car and made an electro banger mixed in the college's studio room. This has the same vibe and feeling, be sure to look up my previous track!

4. **VOiD**  
   VOiD  

5. **Ghost House**  
   ever play Super Mario Bros. World?

6. **a e t h è r**  
   a e t h è r

7. **h o l o g r a H A M**  
   Ham Oarchards...

8. **tokamak**  
   I worked on this track in bed watching "Skinwalker Ranch"
